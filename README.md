## AchievementsOf.Life

A place to document all your achievements (even the smallest ones).

## Motivation behind this.

We often forget to celebrate our small achievements (At least that's the case with me). And Whenever I feel low, I need something to look back to and say "Yes, I have achieved something in life and I'll keep grinding ‚ú®"
